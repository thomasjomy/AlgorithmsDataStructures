4 steps
 First solution through recursive backtracking. You get your base cases. Time complexity will be O(2^N)
 Top down dynamic programming using memoization. This is implemented using a cache. This bring time complexity down to O(N)
 Bottom-up dynamic programming (Tabulation)
 Bottom-up no memory dp
